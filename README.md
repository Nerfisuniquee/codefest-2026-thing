This is such a smart pantry! I bet you've never seen a pantry as smar as this one in particular. This pantry is a smarty pants pantry or something!!

Our project has the primary theme of Healthtech and assistive tech. We have a working proof of concept and how it works is theres a webcam taking photos every 3 hours and claude vision recognizes the stuff and essentially logs it, that is the main premise.
